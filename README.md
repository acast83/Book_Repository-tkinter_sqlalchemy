# Book Repository using Python and tkinter library
This is a simple desktop app I built using tkinter GUI library for Python, sqlite database and sqlalchemy ORM. Book repository provides basic CRUD operations, 
as well as search function. Search function provides case insensitive search and substring search. This was a really fun project to do, 
I learned a lot while working on it.
